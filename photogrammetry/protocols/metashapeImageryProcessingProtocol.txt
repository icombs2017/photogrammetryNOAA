Image Processing Pipeline For Large-Area Imagery


------------------------------
Organize and Filter Imagery

Once cameras are returned from the field, dried, and removed from their housings place images in the proper folder corresponding to the date, site, and camera.

Creating a 3D model in Metashape occurs in three steps with some, but minimal QA/QC steps between.

  a. Load images into Metashape by dragging and dropping images from your folder.
    i. If your photos are using different cameras, load the first camera, right click on the cameras >add camera group> rename to the name of your camera. These camera groups can be renamed

2. *Align Images* Go to Workflow -> Align Photos

  c. Reference Preselection: No
  d. Key Point Limit: 5,000
  e. Tie Point Limit: 0
  f. Constrain Features by Mask: No
  g. Adaptive Camera Model Fitting: Yes



3. *Build Dense Cloud* Go to Workflow -> Build Dense Cloud
  a. Quality: High
  b. Depth Filtering: Mild
  c. Reuse Depth Maps: No

4. *Cleaning Dense Point Cloud* Go to
