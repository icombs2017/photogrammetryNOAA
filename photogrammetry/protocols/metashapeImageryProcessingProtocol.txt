Large-Area Image Processing Protocol

This is the imagery processing workflow used by Mote Marine Laboratory scientists at the Elizabeth Moore International Center for Coral Reef Research and Restoration in Summerland Key, FL.
The workflow outlined below is designed for the creation of Large-Area imgaery products such as 3D dense point clouds and 2D orthomosaics from multiple, overlapping images taken in the field. 
This protocol is written for Agisoft Metashape (https://www.agisoft.com/), more specifically the Agisoft Metashape Professional Edition (https://www.agisoft.com/features/professional-edition/). 
However, many of these functions and features are available in the Standard Edition (https://www.agisoft.com/features/standard-edition/).
Steps and functions within this protocol that are ONLY available in the Professional Edition will be denoted using astrisks on either side of the step. 

------------------------------
Generate a Dense Point Cloud 

Creating a dense point cloud in Metashape occurs in two main steps: Image Alignment and Dense Point Cloud Generation with a few, but minimal, QA/QC steps along the way.

1. Filter Photos
  a. Load images into Metashape by dragging and dropping images from your folder.
    i. If your photos are using different cameras, load the first camera, right click on the cameras>add camera group>rename to the name of your camera 
    ii. Repeat this for your remaining cameras
  Note: We use 2 cameras for the majority of our projects

2. *Detect Markers*
  a. Metashape provides coded targets, or printed markers that can be placed in the scene before photos are taken and could be used as reference points for coordinate system and scale definition, or as a valid matches between images to help camera alignment procedure during image alignment
  b. Navigate to Tools>Markers>Detect Markers
  c. Sometimes markers are incorrectly detected, check your  

3. Align Images 
  a. Navigate to Workflow>Align Photos
    i. Accuracy: High
    ii. Generic Preselection: No
    iii. Reference Preselection: No
    iv. Key Point Limit: 5,000
    v. Tie Point Limit: 0
    vi. Constrain Features by Mask: No
    vii. Adaptive Camera Model Fitting: Yes

4. Build Dense Cloud 
  a. Navigate to Workflow>Build Dense Cloud
    i. Quality: High
    ii. Depth Filtering: Mild
    iii. Reuse Depth Maps: No
    iv. Calculate point confidence: Yes

5. *Cleaning Dense Point Cloud* 
  a. A quick and simple way to clean up your point clouds is by removing the lowest confidence points, to do this navigate to Tools>Dense Cloud>Filter by Confidence
    i. Set Confidence Range
      (1). Min: 0
      (2). Max: 1
  b. This will show only the points that have the LOWEST confidence values, navigate to Model>Rectangle Selection/Circle Selection/Free-Form Selection
  Note: We find that Free-Form Selection is the most flexible and useful
  c. Highlight your entire dense cloud
  d. Press 'Delete'
  e. Navigate to Tools>Dense Cloud>Reset Filter
  f. Your dense clouds should be far less noisy, however you may wish to continue to edit your dense clouds, removing erroneous points. If so, re-select your preferred selection tool (Rectangle, Circle, or Free-form)
  g. Select points you wish to remove
  h. Press 'Delete'
  i. Repeat steps f-h until you are satisfied with your model
