------------------------------
Organize and Filter Imagery

Once cameras are returned from the field, dried, and removed from their housings place images in the proper folder corresponding to the date, site, and camera.

Creating a dense point cloud in Metashape occurs in three steps with some, but minimal, QA/QC steps along the way.

1. *Filter Photos*
  a. Load images into Metashape by dragging and dropping images from your folder.
    i. If your photos are using different cameras, load the first camera, right click on the cameras>add camera group>rename to the name of your camera 
    ii. Repeat this for your remaining cameras
  Note: We use 2 cameras for the majority of our projects

2. *Align Images* Navigate to Workflow>Align Photos
  a. Accuracy: High
  b. Generic Preselection: No
  c. Reference Preselection: No
  d. Key Point Limit: 5,000
  e. Tie Point Limit: 0
  f. Constrain Features by Mask: No
  g. Adaptive Camera Model Fitting: Yes

3. *Build Dense Cloud* Navigate to Workflow>Build Dense Cloud
  a. Quality: High
  b. Depth Filtering: Mild
  c. Reuse Depth Maps: No
  d. Calculate point confidence: Yes

4. *Cleaning Dense Point Cloud* Navigate to Tools>Dense Cloud>Filter by Confidence
