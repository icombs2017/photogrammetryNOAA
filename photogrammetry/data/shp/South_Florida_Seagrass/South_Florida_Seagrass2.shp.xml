			<abstract>This polygon GIS data set represents a compilation of statewide seagrass data from various source agencies and scales.  The data were mapped from sources ranging in date from 1987 to 2009.  Not all data in this compilation are mapped from photography; some are the results of field measurements. See the "Sources" section for more information. 

The original source data sets were not all classified in the same manner; some used the Florida Land Use Cover and Forms Classification System (FLUCCS) codes 9113 for discontinuous seagrass and 9116 for continuous seagrass; some defined only presence and absence of seagrass, and some defined varying degrees of seagrass percent cover.  In order to merge all of these data sources into one compilation data set, FWRI reclassified the various source data attribute schemes into two categories: "Continuous Seagrass" and "Patchy (Discontinuous) Seagrass". In areas where studies overlap, the most recent study where a given area has been interpreted is represented in this data set.

This data set is not comparable to previous statewide data sets for time series studies - not all areas have been updated since the previous statewide compilation and some areas previously not mapped are now included. Please contact GIS Librarian to request the source data if you need to do a time series comparison.

This data set has been updated in several areas from the previous compilation, including Indian River Lagoon (2009), Northern Miami-Dade (2009), Biscayne Bay (2005), Dry Tortugas (2006), and Parts of Rookery Bay NERR (2003-2006).</abstract>
			<purpose>This GIS data set was developed to represent the most recent seagrass mapping available in Florida for current statewide display and analysis. Not all areas have been mapped. This data set includes areas that were not previously mapped in other statewide compilations. This data set is not appropriate for time series comparisons to previous statewide compilations.
</purpose>
			<supplinf>Prior to July 1, 2004, the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) was known as the Florida Marine Research Institute (FMRI). The institute name has not been changed in historical data sets or references to work completed by the Florida Marine Research Institute. The institute name has been changed in references to ongoing research, new research, and contact information. 

These data are for statewide mapping and analysis only. The original regional data sets may contain more detailed seagrass attribution schemes. Contact GIS Librarian to request the source data sets.</supplinf>

		<complete>These data are complete as of data available to FWRI in September, 2010. The study areas for the source data varied. Offshore data have not been mapped to any consistent distance or depth statewide. 

Broward and Collier counties are included; however, these counties were mapped using field measurements, rather than complete aerial photography, so additional unmapped seagrass may still be present within these counties. Additional data gaps may be present. Contact GIS Librarian to request extent of mapping.</complete>

Those areas are represented in the final compilation data set using data that was interpreted in previous studies (benthic_south_fl and seagrass_swcoast_fl_1987). All relevant polygons from this data set were used.

This data set was originally classified using the Florida System for Classification of Habitats and Marine Environments (SCHEME). Codes were reclassified as follows:

211 (Continuous SRV) and 211cc (Continuous SRV, bank) were classified as "Continuous Seagrass"; 
212 (Discontinuous SRV) and 212cc (Discontinuous SRV, bank) were classified as "Patchy (Discontinuous) Seagrass".</srccontr>

This data set originally used the FKNMS Benthic Classification System. The simplified "Super" classes were reclassified as follows:

SGC (Continuous Seagrass) was reclassified to "Continuous Seagrass";

No seagrass density attributes were recorded, so all polygons were classified as "Patchy (Discontinuous) Seagrass" by default. This information is not intended to provide an exhaustive coverage of seagrass in Broward County.  Additional areas of seagrass are believed to exist, but have not yet been verified by staff.</srccontr>

				<srccontr>This is the most current data for the area; all seagrass polygons are used.

The source data were originally classified using the Florida Land Use, Cover and Forms Classification System (FLUCCS). Data were reclassified as follows:

9113 (Discontinuous Seagrass) was reclassified to "Patchy (Discontinuous) Seagrass"; 
9116 (Continuous Seagrass) was reclassified to "Continuous Seagrass".</srccontr>

				<srccontr>This data set is overlapped by more recent data benthic_rookerybay_nerr_part, benthic_south_fl and benthic_flbay_2004. It is only used where no more recent data exists, or to fill in gaps where the more recent data were uninterpreted. 

The source data recorded presence/absence of seagrass without indication of density. In areas where seagrass is present (SCLASS = 4) the data were reclassified "Patchy (Discontinuous) Seagrass" by default.</srccontr>

				<srccontr>This is the most recent data for the area represented. All relevant polygons from this data set have been included. 

The source data were originally classified using the USGS derived C-CAP Coastal Land Cover Classification System. Data were reclassified as follows:

CSG was reclassified as "Continuous Seagrass"; 
PSG1, PSG2, PSG3, and PSG4 were reclassified as "Patchy (Discontinuous) Seagrass".</srccontr>
			</srcinfo>
			<procstep>
				<procdesc>FWRI staff added four attributes to each data set:

SEAGRASS - indicates "continuous" or "discontinuous". If a seagrass data set only indicated presence/absence this attribute defaulted to discontinuous.
SOURCEDATE - year(s) of photography. Also indicates if date is unknown or if the polygon was not interpreted from photography.
METADATA - the information in this field will be populated with a link to the metadata for the source data set that the polygon came from once the source metadata is online. Currently it is the source data set name used as a placeholder.
DESCRIPT - standardized name field for labeling maps. Values include "Continuous Seagrass", or "Discontinuous Seagrass".

Staff used the most recent information for an area. Staff determined the most recent information by creating footprints of all source polygons, minus any large land polygons and uninterpreted areas. Staff used these footprints with the ArcGIS Toolbox command "erase" to eliminate areas of overlap from older source data sets. In some areas the exclusion of shoreline resulted in sliver polygons due to different studies using different shorelines. Staff manually deleted these slivers after the "erase", defaulting to the more recent shoreline coverage.

Once all the data were properly "erased", staff loaded all of the data into a single geodatabase feature class. Running a topology resulted in no overlaps. If an area was uninterpreted within a more recent study, but interpreted in an older study, then the older study was used. 

Sliver polygons less than one square meter were deleted. Any additional slivers are either due to preserving the "Source" attribute or they were present in the original source data sets.</procdesc>
