NOAA Settlement Tiles: Bleaching Instructions 2.0

Written by Brooke Pohlman 7/21/2022

You will need:
Settlement tiles (located in Dive Locker)
Sandpaper
Reef glue
5-gallon plastic buckets
Bleach (~10% dilution)
Pen and paper, or datasheet
1 Sharpie
Ziploc bags

-Prepare your tile for glue. Sand down algae or other fouling organisms in one corner of your settlement tile, smooth side up. It is recommended that you pick the same corner on all tiles for consistency,
 i.e. the top left corner. Wipe away any extra moisture and material so that the surface is mostly smooth for glue.
-Using Reef glue, evenly distribute glue along the back of the waterproof paper tag that was included in your tile’s Ziploc bag. Place your label on the prepared portion of the tile, smooth side up, being
 sure not to get glue on your fingers or adjacent surfaces if possible. Slowly slide the label around and press glue out towards the edges of the paper to ensure it is flat and secure once dried.
-Set the tile, label side up, on a flat surface to dry. It is recommended that the tiles set out to dry for a few minutes before they are stacked in buckets to bleach, so that the glue can dry and will
 not fall off.
-Repeat steps 1-3 for the remainder of the settlement tiles.
-Once all the tiles have been glued on, begin to number them in order. Ordering your settlement tiles in the bucket, and recording the order, will ensure you can identify which tile is which, in the case
 that the tags do fall off, and makes the re-bagging process go faster. Also, the sharpie marker on the waterproof label will fade with the sun and bleach mixture, so if it is hard to read you are
 prepared.
-Once all the tiles have been ordered, copy the sequence into a data sheet for future reference.
-Stack the settlement tiles into the bucket. Tiles should be placed in line with one another and with their label and smooth side up horizontally. In either ascending or descending numerical order, keep
the tiles in sequence when you place them into your bucket. Do NOT stack tiles vertically along the sides of the bucket. Do NOT overfill your bucket, ensuring it is light enough to move around the
facility once water is added and so that they will not topple over.
-Fill the buckets with bleach mixture. Wearing proper PPE for protection, fill the buckets with tiles with a 10:1 water and bleach solution. Ensure that the water level is high enough to completely
submerge all the tiles. If there is no pre-diluted bleach, estimate to the best of your ability. It is better to have a higher than a lower concentration of bleach.
-Find a safe place to store your bucket, preferably somewhere covered or with a lid in the case of adverse weather. Use a sharpie and painter’s tape to label your buckets and disclose the contents
containing bleach.
-Let the tiles soak 2-3 days in the bleach solution, or until the majority of tiles have no more tissue or excess coloration.
-While your tiles are soaking, you can prepare your Ziploc bags for re-bagging. Using your datasheet, write the tile’s sequence number on the front of the baggie. Stack baggies in numerical order, so
you can go through top to bottom when re-bagging and save time.
-Once your tiles are finished soaking, it is time to set them out to dry. Wearing proper PPE again to handle the bleach solution, remove the tiles and set them out to dry outdoors, still in numerical
order and label side up. A surface that allows air flow underneath and so that water does not well up underneath is best, like gravel. Drying time will depend on sun exposure and weather conditions.
Properly dispose of Bleach mixture when finished, and rinse down all tools.
-After the tiles are dry, you can begin bagging them. Since your Ziploc bags are written and in order, you can go down your list start to end and bag your settlement tiles down the line. Refer to your
original ordered list if the sharpie label is illegible.
-Store your settlement tiles somewhere cool and dry until they are ready to be analyzed.


Best Practices….
-Smaller batches, more frequently. I recommend a Monday-Thursday schedule for bleaching and rotating a new batch in.
-35 is a good amount stacked vertically only per 5 gallon bucket.
-Keep your tiles in order! I can’t emphasize this enough.
-Remove the tiles in smaller groups from the freezer when sanding them down. If they sit out too long and defrost, there is too much extra moisture, it's a mess, they smell and it may inhibit the glue’s
effectiveness.
-Only stack the tiles in the same direction, on top of each other horizontally, in the buckets. We have previously had problems adding more tiles on the sides of the bucket vertically breaking or
missing their identity. Plus, the more you add to the bucket, the heavier it will be to transport later on.
